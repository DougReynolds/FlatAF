## Overview
FlatAF is a professional-grade astrophotography flat panel controller, powered by a Seeed Studio XIAO ESP32C6 running MicroPython.

## Core Features
- Dynamic LED brightness control (16-bit precision)
- Wi-Fi based control via ASCOM Alpaca driver
- Automatic fallback to AP Mode if Wi-Fi is unavailable
- Simple Web UI for initial setup and network configuration
- Persistent brightness storage and recovery
- Fully headless operation after configuration

## Basic Use Guide
- See [README.md](../README.md) in the main FlatAF project for user-facing behavior and operation details:
  - Button toggle and long-press behavior
  - USB vs battery power usage
  - Grove power switch function
  - Antenna positioning for optimal Wi-Fi
  - Battery use and charging best practices

## Deployment

### Prerequisites
- Seeed Studio XIAO ESP32C6 board flashed with MicroPython 1.25.0 or later
- USB-C cable for initial deployment
- mpremote installed (pip install mpremote)
- Git repository cloned with FlatAF device firmware

### USB Deploy Script
Connect device to your computer.

Run:
```bash
./deploy.sh
```

This will:
- Wipe the filesystem (excluding wifi_config.json unless --full-wipe is used)
- Upload all necessary firmware files
- Soft reboot the device

By default, `deploy.sh` preserves your `wifi_config.json` file, so your Wi-Fi credentials are not lost during normal deployments. To fully wipe the filesystem, including `wifi_config.json`, use the `--full-wipe` flag:
```bash
./deploy.sh --full-wipe
```

### Manual Upload (Optional)
It is often useful to manually upload a single file's changes without full deployment.

To upload manually:
```bash
mpremote connect /dev/tty.usbmodem101 fs cp boot.py :
mpremote connect /dev/tty.usbmodem101 fs cp web_server.py :
mpremote connect /dev/tty.usbmodem101 fs cp led.py :
...
```
Perform a soft-reboot to ensure that device firmware is updated.  See [REPL Useful Keyboard Shortcuts](#repl-useful-keyboard-shortcuts) for information on reboot.

## Configuration

### Wi-Fi Setup
`wifi_config.json` is created automatically in the AP process for configuring SSID and Password for the network configuration.  It is removed with a long button press, effectively resetting FlatAF to AP mode.

If `wifi_config.json` exists:
- Device attempts to connect to the saved network.

If `wifi_config.json` is missing or invalid:
- Device automatically starts in Access Point (AP) Mode with SSID FlatAF-Setup and password flataf123.

### AP Mode Recovery
Connect to the FlatAF-Setup Wi-Fi network.

Open a browser and navigate to:
``` 
http://192.168.4.1:5555/
```

Enter new Wi-Fi credentials.

Device will save the configuration, reboot, and attempt connection to the new network.

## API Reference

- `GET /api/v1/covercalibrator/0/connected`  
  Returns whether the device is currently connected.

- `PUT /api/v1/covercalibrator/0/connected`  
  Sets the device connection state.

- `GET /api/v1/covercalibrator/0/brightness`  
  Returns the current LED brightness (0â€“65535).

- `PUT /api/v1/covercalibrator/0/brightness`  
  Sets the LED brightness.

- `PUT /api/v1/covercalibrator/0/setbrightness?Brightness=####`  
  Alternate form to set brightness explicitly via query parameter.

- `PUT /api/v1/covercalibrator/0/toggle`  
  Toggles the LED between ON and OFF.

- `PUT /api/v1/covercalibrator/0/calibratoron`  
  Turns the LED on.

- `PUT /api/v1/covercalibrator/0/calibratoroff`  
  Turns the LED off.

- `GET /api/v1/covercalibrator/0/maxbrightness`  
  Returns the maximum allowed LED brightness.

- `GET /api/v1/covercalibrator/0/driverinfo`  
  Returns device driver info string.

- `GET /api/v1/covercalibrator/0/interfaceversion`  
  Returns the Alpaca interface version supported.

- `GET /api/version`  
  Returns the FlatAF firmware version (if served by MicroPython).

- `GET /management/apiversions`  
  Lists the supported management API versions.

- `GET /` or `GET /index`  
  Loads the web interface homepage (used for Wi-Fi setup).

- `GET /astroAF_logo2.png`  
  Loads the logo asset used in the Web UI.

## Troubleshooting
- Device doesn't show up on network  
  Connect via USB and check logs. Re-enter Wi-Fi config if necessary via AP mode.
- Cannot reach setup page in AP Mode  
  Confirm Wi-Fi SSID is FlatAF-Setup and manually visit `http://192.168.4.1:5555/`.
- LED not responding  
  Check wiring and power supply. Confirm GPIO pin assignment in firmware matches your board.

## REPL Cheat Sheet
This cheat sheet provides quick reference commands for connecting to the FlatAF device via REPL and manually controlling behavior without needing Wi-Fi or NINA.

### Connecting to FlatAF via REPL
List Available USB Devices
```bash
ls /dev/tty.usb*
```

Connect to Device via mpremote
```bash
mpremote connect /dev/tty.usbmodem101
```

Successful connection will show the `>>>` REPL prompt.

### File System Management with mpremote
```bash
mpremote connect /dev/tty.usbmodem101 fs ls
mpremote connect /dev/tty.usbmodem101 fs cp myfile.py :
mpremote connect /dev/tty.usbmodem101 fs rm myfile.py
```

From REPL:
```python
import os
print(os.listdir())
```

### Manual FlatAF Control via REPL
```python
import ascom_api
ascom_api.set_device_brightness(32768)
ascom_api.turn_calibrator_on()
ascom_api.turn_calibrator_off()
ascom_api.fade_to_brightness(20000)
ascom_api.toggle_device()
ascom_api.get_device_status()
ascom_api.get_max_brightness()
```

### REPL Useful Keyboard Shortcuts
- Ctrl-D  
  Soft reboot the device
- Ctrl-E  
  Enter multi-line paste mode
- Ctrl-X  
  Exit multi-line paste mode
- Ctrl-]  
  Exit REPL session (via mpremote)

Use multi-line paste mode for copying larger code blocks cleanly into REPL.

### FlatAF REPL Test Suite

The full automated test script is located at:
```bash
test/device_tests.py
```

To run the tests:
```bash
mpremote connect /dev/tty.usbmodem101 run test/device_tests.py
```

This script verifies core LED control functionality and outputs results directly to REPL.

The HTTP endpoint tests are located at:
```bash
test/postman
```
In this folder you will find two files, a postman environment and collection.  See the README contained within this directory for specific documentation.

## Notes
- These commands do not require Wi-Fi.
- Ideal for debugging without NINA.
- Manual REPL behavior mirrors API endpoint behavior.



## System Status
- NINA reconnects after device reboot.
- Disconnect command turns LED off.

## Licensing
See the [FlatAF main project license](../LICENSE.md) for full licensing details.
