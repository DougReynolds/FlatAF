## Additional Notes

- These tests assume the FlatAF device is connected to the network and the `web_server.py` service is running and accessible via the IP in your environment.
- The UUID and other values in the environment file are placeholders and may be safely replaced as needed.
- Additional test coverage for edge cases will be provided by Alpaca ConformU compliance testing.
